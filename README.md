Hello, and thanks for dropping in!
I built this site using HTML and CSS (flexbox, grid, et al..), with a sprinkling of JavaScript to make it mobile-friendly (see responsive layout and fancy hamburger animation).

It's still a work in progress, and I'm continuing to tinker with it while finishing small projects to add to the site.

Please come back again to see more changes over the coming weeks!

Have a great day, Kirsty
