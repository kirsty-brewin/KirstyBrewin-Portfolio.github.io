        <h1>Who the heck is Kirsty, and why did she switch to Web Development?</h1>
        <p>Kia ora from Wellington! I'm Kirsty, a Yorkshire lass with a deep appreciation of the absurdity
          of everyday life. I've lived over here for nearly 18 years, and despite some hankering to return to Northern
          England, I call Wellington my home.
        </p>
        <p>I started life wanting to be an Olympic runner, then a police officer, then a typographist, then a sound
          engineer, then a.. well, the list goes on. In 'grown-up' life I have studied/worked in web content management,
          conservation biology, written comms, event management, policy, natural resource stewardship and bicycle
          mechanics. If you asked me now what I'd like to be when I grow up, I'd say whatever challenges me and makes me
          happy.</p>
        <h2>I'm a creative thinker and problem-solver, with a side dollop of humour.</h2>
        <p>Then came the lightbulb moment! I realised the things that brought me great joy throughout my study and
          work experiences came beautifully packaged in one career - tech!. So, months later I completed a very intense
          but hugely satisfying Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp with Dev Academy Aotearoa. It confirmed my fondness
          for crafting
          beautiful, user friendly websites, and an intention to follow the ever evolving path into tech.
        </p>
        <h2>I love turning code into simple, creative solutions.</h2>
        <p>I'm still in the very early stages of my new career, but I think my strengths get on reeaally well
          with those needed to
          succeed as a developer. Take problem solving. I am known for my ridiculous ability to fix any broken washing
          machine. I have no idea why my talent is fixed to that particular genre of machinery, but there it is. Another
          is perseverance. Have you seen the Terminator? Enough said.</p>

        <p>All this talk about machines, but what about humans? That's where my strengths really soar. I thoroughly
          enjoy and invite communication of all kinds - written, verbal, creative (samba percussion anyone?). Never got
          the hang of morse code.</p>
        <p>I'm ready for opportunities that will help me build on my shiny new skills as a web developer, in a
          supportive and nurturing team. </p>
